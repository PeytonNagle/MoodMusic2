## Business Level planned functionality changes

- Change to max 2 attempts before taking away hard popularity filter
- When logging in should be able to hit enter instead of being forced to click 'Log in'
- Cookies to stay logged in

- Maybe stream songs as they are received from Gemini (would have to use Vercel or some sort of gen AI streaming framework/lib)

### More details ui on song
