# .claude Directory

This directory contains Claude Code-specific files for this project.

## Structure

- `plans/` - Implementation plans and architectural documentation created by Claude Code
  - These are committed to the repository as they serve as living documentation
  - Plans include analysis, recommendations, and implementation roadmaps

## Purpose

This directory is the default workspace for Claude Code when working on this project. It keeps all AI-assisted planning and analysis organized within the project context rather than in the global `~/.claude/` directory.

## Gitignore

Plans are committed to the repository as they provide valuable project documentation. Temporary files or session data may be excluded via `.gitignore` if needed.
